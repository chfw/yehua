Please note, since version 0.0.2, the command line is shortened. Due to
time constaints, the demo video uses `yehua` still.

Simply type in and you are taken care of::

    $ yh

It will do these for you:

#. Consult you on your project static information which can update as
   many as you want to.
#. Create the Python package folder structure
#. Initialize the package as git project

You will simply need to commit it after you will have reviewed the
generated files.

Cookiecutter users
--------------------------

Yes, we now support cookiecutter templates. It has been requested since 2018
Europython. Simply there is tons of cookiecutter templates out there. What
you do is to replace 'cookiecutter' with 'yh'::

    $ yh git://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage.git

And what moremoban promise is, whenever your source template changes, you
can synchronize them any time with another moremoban's command 'moban':

    $ moban

Yes, you need a separate command, which replaces your effort to synchronize
the upstream templates all the time.


Tutorial
-----------------

Let's make a python command line utility using `yehua`. The command
will be `hello` and it prints `world`. You will need to issue::

    $ pip install yehua

before proceeding.

Step 1 Let's launch yehua
******************************
|slide1|

Step 2 Fill-in the meta data for your project
***********************************************
|slide2|

At the end, yehua generates a folder named 'hello', which contains all necessary
files for

#. installing it as a package
#. testing via nose
#. sharing it on github
#. configuring travis via github

Step 3 Inflates the meta data
**********************************
Let's change to 'hello' directory

|slide3|

All meta data is inflated via **`moban`_ automatically**
The templates come from `setupmobans`_
Run moban. It inflates the all meta data.

|slide4|

Why is moban involved here? It helps reduce duplicated meta data when
your project grows. For example, yehua had this tutorial in README and in sphinx
documentation. I wrote it in one file and moban copies it to both
places. What's more, it helps further when the number of your
project grows. For example, `pyexcel`_ project has dozens of
sub projects. I wrote most of the generic documentation in
`pyexcel commons`_ and moban copies them across all sub projects.

Step 4 Start coding
*************************
Let's write up the actual code in hello/main.py

|slide5|

Put in just a main() function and save it.

|slide6|

Why is it enough? yehua generates a command utility python and
it has pre-wired to invoke hello.main.main() function. You
can find it out in setup.py.

Step 5 Install it
*********************
Now all is done. Let's install it

|slide7|

Step 6 Run it
********************

Let's run it

|slide8|

All done.

Step 7 push to github
***************************

Suppose you are happy with everything. Please do the following to
push it to your github::

    $ git init
    $ git add *
    $ git add .gitignore .moban.d/ .moban.yml .travis.yml
    $ git commit -am ":sparkle: initial commit"

Then create your project repository in github and do these to push it out::

    $ git remote add origin https://github.com/moremoban/hello.git
    $ git push origin master

{% if page != 'readme' %}

|slide9|

|slide10|

{% endif %}

You can find the `hello project`_ on github.

Step 8 enable travis
***************************

The generated project already has `.travis.yml` file. What you
will need to do is to register with travis.org if you have not
done so. And then go to travis and activate your project.
