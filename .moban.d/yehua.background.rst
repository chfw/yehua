The original problem I was trying to solve is: I would like to place
common paragraphs in the documentation of my projects in a central
place (pyexcel-mobans), and all projects could reference it dynamically
so that when those common paragraphs get updated, the updates can be
easily propagated to all relevant projects. The derived problem is:
what can I do to a new project? I found myself doing a lot of
copy-and-paste a lot, which lead to the creation of "yehua". Later,
John Vandenberg, an active member of coala, suggested extracting the
generic sets of pyexcel-mobans to form pypi-mobans, so that
a vanilla python package can be created. Why not cookiecutter?
Well, I have not heard of it at the time of creation. But it turns out
that this project started to pave the way to be the cookiecutter
for organisations.

Why to choose "yehua"? Here is `the little story`_ behind the
choice of name. And this `music video`_ would help bridge the
cultural gap between you and me.
